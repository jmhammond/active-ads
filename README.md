This is a repository of materials for flipped class using Applied Discrete Structures. The class format these files are based is to assign students to read materials that will be covered in class n in time to submit a short assignment by the beginning of class n-1.  Then at the time of class n, they work on more challenging problems in groups of 4-6 students.  
The tricky thing about this format is getting started. On class 1, no prior reading can be expected.  The binary representation of positive integers is discussed.  This is mostly done through group work. The assumption is that since most student in the class are computer science majors, they have some familiarity with the topic and can help get any other students with the problems.  Class 2 is also a bit of rush.
