<div class="para">Read Sections 13.1 and 13.2 of <em class="emphasis">Applied Discrete Structures</em>. Partial orderings were introduced in Chapter 6 and you might want to review the definition before you start on Chapter 13. You might recall that partial orderings tend to compare certain pairs of elements in a poset according to some size, where size might not always mean size in the conventional sense.  In any case, if we take two elements from a poset, an upper bound is something in the poset that is comparably larger than them both.  A lower bound is defined similarly. In some cases, we can define binary operations (“join” and “meet”) based on this idea.  When we can, we get an algebraic structure called a <em class="emphasis">lattice</em>.</div>
