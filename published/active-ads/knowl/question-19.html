<div class="para">One of the main reasons why recurrence relations are part of this course is that the time and/or memory needs of a computer algorithm are often measured by first identifying a recurrence relation.  Once solved, many sorting algorithm are found to take a time that is proportional to <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> to sort <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> items.  If you are using an algorithm of this type, and it takes three minutes to sort a file with 10 million items, how long would you expect the algorithm to take to sort 20 million items?</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="reading-21.html#question-19" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
