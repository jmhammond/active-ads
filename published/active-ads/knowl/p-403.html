<div class="para">Answer to the last in-class question in the previous chapter: These clues give you numbers in ascending order: The TWO Ronnies, the THREE colours trilogy, the Famous FIVE, the Hateful EIGHT, Thurberâ€™s THIRTEEN clocks. This is a Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two. The next number in the sequence (and the answer to the question) must therefore be 21 - as in the rock band, 21 Pilots. This was a question posed at the end of Programme 7 of the 2020 Round Britain Quiz.</div>
