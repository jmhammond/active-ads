Furthermore, suppose that <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> stands for banana.  Then to say you could have as many as two bananas, we could write <span class="process-math">\(B^0+B^1+B^2=1+B+B^2\text{.}\)</span>  Suppose that in addition you could have up to three apples (use <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> for apples) and zero or one pears (use <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> for pears).  What algebraic expression represents all your choices in selecting fruits?  Identify the part of this expression where you select exactly two pieces of fruit.</div></article></body>
