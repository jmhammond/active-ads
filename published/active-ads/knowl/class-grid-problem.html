<div class="para">A classroom has 5 rows of desks, with 7 desks in each row.   Suppose we want to represent this rectangular arrangement of desks in an undirected graph, where each desk is connected to the neighboring desks to it’s front, back, left and right.  Of course, some desks have fewer than four neighbors.</div>
