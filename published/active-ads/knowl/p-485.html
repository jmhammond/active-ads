<div class="para">In answering the question “Is every Eulerian graph also Hamiltonian?” Hansel pointed out an Eulerian circuit in a specific graph that visited several vertices more than once.  He concluded that this graph can’t be Hamiltonian since a Hamiltonian circuit visits each vertex exactly once. Therefore, the answer to the question is “No!” Is his answer correct? Is his reasoning correct?  Explain your answers.</div>
