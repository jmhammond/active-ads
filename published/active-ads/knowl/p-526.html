<div class="para">The chromatic polynomial of a <span class="process-math">\(K_{3,3}\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(x^6-9 x^5+36 x^4-75 x^3+78 x^2-31 x\text{.}\)</span> One way to derive this is as follows. We partition the possible ways to color the “left side” of the graph according to how many different colors are used.  It’s possible to use the same color for all vertices, two colors for them or three different colors.  If the same color is used on the left, there are <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> ways to do that, and then <span class="process-math">\((x-1)^3\)</span> ways to color the right. If there are two colors used on the left, there are three ways to select the vertex that has a unique color and then there are <span class="process-math">\(x(x-1)\)</span> ways to select the two colors. This second possible scheme is finished by coloring the right side in one of  <span class="process-math">\((x-2)^3\)</span> ways.  Finally, if all three of the left side vertices are colored differently, this can be done <span class="process-math">\(x(x-1)(x-2)\)</span> ways and the right side can then be colored in one of <span class="process-math">\((x-3)^3\)</span> ways.  To sum up the total number of ways to color our graph is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
x (x-1)^3  +3x (x-1) (x-2)^3 + x (x-1) (x-2) (x-3)^3= x^6-9 x^5+36 x^4-75 x^3+78 x^2-31 x
