<div class="para">The problems and ideas that make up this work come from several sources.  Many of the problems are taken directly from <em class="emphasis">Applied Discrete Structures</em>, mostly even numbered problems for which no solutions are published. In some cases, the problem are slightly altered.  I’ve also mined problems from other sources.  Some were clearly in the “public domain” in that they have appeared in several places over many years.  In those cases, I haven’t identified the source.   There have been a few problems or ideas that seemed somewhat more novel, and I’ve noted their source. Books by Bogart (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-bogart-2017.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 1: Combinatorics Through Guided Discovery">[1]</a>) and Levin (<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-levin-2020.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 3: Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction">[3]</a>) are among these sources.</div>
