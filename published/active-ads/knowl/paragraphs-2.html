On class 1 of the first semester, no prior reading can be expected. The binary representation of positive integers is discussed. This is mostly done through group work. The assumption is that since most students in the class are computer science majors, they have some familiarity with the topic and can help  other students with the problems. Class 2 is also a bit of a rush. I ask students to do reading for that class and get responses back to me a couple of days before the second class. They are also asked to prepare for Class 3 and get responses to me by Class 2.   Fortunately, the material in Chapter 1 isnâ€™t too difficult.  The rest of the semester proceeds as described above. In the second semester, the first class is taken up by reviewing the most important concepts from the first semester through sequence of problems. Another quick turn-around in the reading for Class 2 is needed to get into the flow.  After that the second semester proceeds the same as the first.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="active-ads-preface.html#paragraphs-2" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
