However, counting a different way can lead to an interesting  identity involving binomial coefficients.  Notice that any path goes through exactly one of the points <span class="process-math">\((0,8), (1,7), (2,6), \dots , (8,0)\text{.}\)</span>  Count the number of lattice paths that go through each of those 9 points - leave the expression in terms of binomial coefficients.
