<title>Logic: Propositions and Truth Tables</title>
<idx>Propositions and Truth Tables</idx>
<section xml:id="reading-6"><title>Reading</title>
<p>Read sections 3.1 and 3.2 of Applied Discrete Structures.</p>
<p>Response Question: Suppose you were given a proposition generated by 100 propositional variables and you are asked whether there is at least one assignment of truth values that you could assign to these variables to make the proposition true. Why is constructing a truth table not practical.  If you decided to examine all possible assignments of truth values and your computer could check one million cases per second, approximately how long would it take to check all cases?</p>
<p>Also, turn in solutions to these exercises:

				<li> <p>Write the converse of the statement.</p></li>

				<li> <p>Suppose the original statement is true, and that Boris eats fried clams. Can you conclude anything (about his travels)?</p></li>
