<title>Solving Linear Recurrence Relations I</title>
<idx>Homogeneous Recurrence Relations</idx>
<section xml:id="reading-21"><title>Reading</title>
<p>Read the first three subsections of Section 8.3 of <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>.  This will take you up to, but not including the section titled <q>Solution of Nonhomogeneous Finite Order Linear Relations</q>. </p>
<p>Response Question: One of the main reasons why recurrence relations are part of this course is that the time and/or memory needs of a computer algorithm are often measured by first identifying a recurrence relation.  For example many sorting algorithm take a time that is proportional to <m>n^2</m> to sort <m>n</m> items.  If you are using an algorithm of this type, and it takes three minutes to sort a file with 10 million items, how long would you expect the algorithm to take to sort 20 million items?</p>
<p>Also, turn in solutions to these exercises: 
	<ul><li>Find a closed form expression that for the sequence <m>S(n)</m> if  <m>S(0)=4</m> and <m>S(n)=3 \dot S(n-1)</m> if <m>n \gt 0</m>.</li>
	<ul><li><p>Find a closed form expression that for the sequence <m>T(n)</m> if  <m>T(0)=1</m>, <m>T(1)= 5</m> and <m>T(n)- 3\dot T(n-1) + 4\dot T(n-2)=0</m> if <m>n \gt 2</m>.</p></li>

<li><p>Find a closed form expression that for the sequence <m>V(n)</m> if  <m>V(0)=2</m>, <m>V(1)= 3</m> and <m>V(n)= \frac{1}{2}\dot V(n-1)- \frac{1}{2}\dot V(n-2)</m> if <m>n \gt 2</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a closed form expression that for the sequence <m>Q(n)</m> if  <m>Q(0)=3</m>, <m>Q(1)= 0</m> and <m>Q(n)=6\dot Q(n-1)-9\dot Q(n-2)</m> if <m>n \gt 2</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>Find a closed form expression that for the sequence <m>Q(n)</m> if  <m>Q(0)=3</m>, <m>Q(1)= 0</m> and <m>Q(n)=6\dot Q(n-1)-9\dot Q(n-2)</m> if <m>n \gt 2</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>The recurrence relation <m>R(n)=R(n-1)+2^n</m>, <m>n \geq 1</m> is non-homogeneous.  This is the subject of the next class, but it can be turned into a second order homogeneous recurrence relation.  So so and find the general solution to that recurrence relation.</li></ol>
