		<exercise><statement><p>A teacher decides to have their students grade one another's quizzes.  The scheme that is devised is that when a bell is rung, each  student is to pass their quiz to a classmate either to the front, back, right or left of themselves.  Suppose that class is arranged in rectanglar configuration of 5 rows of seven students each. Is is possible for each student to get exactly one quiz to grade?
