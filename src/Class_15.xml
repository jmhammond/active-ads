<p>Response Question: Although any subset of a cartesian product of a set with itself can be a relation on that set, in the long run we are most concerned with a few important ones.  Three examples of very important relations are
<ul>
<li><p>Less than or equal to,<m>\leq</m>, on the integers,</p></li>
<li><p>Set containment, <m>\subeq</m>, on the power set of a set,</p></li>
<li><p>Logical implication, <m>\Rightarrow</m>, on any set of propositions.</p></li>
</ul>
Discuss any similarities you see between these three relations.
</p>
<p>Also, turn in solutions to these exercises: 
	<ul><li><p>Consider the two relations on people: <m>M</m>, where <m>aMb</m> if <m>a</m>'s mother is <m>b</m>; and <m>S</m>, where  <m>aSb</m> if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are siblings.  Describe, in words, the two relations <m>MS</m> and <m>SM</m>.</p></li>
	<li><p> Let <m>A = \{1,2,3,4,6,12\}</m>.  Draw a digraph for the relation <q>divides</q> on <m>A</m>.</p></li>
				</ul>  </p>
