<section xml:id="reading-109"><title>Reading Assignment</title>
<p>Read Section 11.3 of <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>.  In this section we examine some of the basic theorems that follow immediately from the axioms of a group. Reviewing the proofs is a good exercise in solidifying an understanding of the axioms. In most cases, these theorems are applied in later work without explicitly stating them. </p>
<question><title>Response Question</title><statement><p>SageMath can be used to explore concrete groups.  It can't be used to prove significant theorems, but you can verify that the theorems are true.  Here is one particular group's operation table generated using Sage. The group, with domain <c>[a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h]</c>, is in a family called the dihedral groups, and will be encountered in Section 15.3. For the purposes of this question, notice that in the body of the table, each element appears exactly once in each row and column.  Which theorem guarantees that this is always true for a group's operation table?</p>

<section xml:id="handouts-109"><title>Some Theorems</title>
<p>Two of the theorems in Section 10.3 follow. In doing the exercises, you don't need to prove these theorems or the others in the section.</p>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-11-3-cancellation"><title>Cancellation Laws</title>
<idx>Cancellation in Groups </idx>
<statement><p>If <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> are elements of group <m>G</m>, then
 <me>
 \begin{array}{lc}
 \textrm{left cancellation: }&amp; (a * b = a * c)  \Rightarrow b = c\\
 \textrm{right cancellation: }&amp;  (b * a = c * a) \Rightarrow b = c\\
 \end{array}
 </me>
</p></statement>
</theorem>

<theorem xml:id="theorem-11-3-finite"><title>last theorem in Section 11.3</title>
<statement><p> If <m>G</m> is a finite group,  <m>\left| G\right| = n</m>, and <m>a</m> is an element of <m>G</m>, then there exists a positive integer <m>m</m> such
