			  <description>A weighted undirected graph on 10 vertices. The edges are are given by the list of triples [[1,2,8],[1,5,6],[1,9,7],[1,10,10],[3,5,11],[3,7,9],[4,9,13],[5,8,12],[6,7,5],[6,10,13]], where the first two entries are the vertices of the edge and the last entry is its weight.</description>

		</statement><solution><p>The edges that are added, in order are {1,5}, {1,9}, {1,2},{9,7}, {7,6},{7,3},{1,10},{5,8},{9,4}.  This assumes that if there is a tie in possibly adding an edge, the smallest vertex number is added, which is the case when {1,2} is added.</p></solution></exercise>
