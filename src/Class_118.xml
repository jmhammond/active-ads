<p>Response Question: How did Galois die, and why am I asking you this?</p>
<p>Also, turn in solutions to these exercises: 
	<ol label="1."><li>What does Lagrange's Theorem say about the possible subgroups of a group of order 12?</li>
		<li>Let <m>H</m> be the subgroup <m>\{0,25,50,75\}</m> of the additive group <m>\mathbb{Z}_{100}</m>. How many distinct left cosets are there of H?  What coset contains the number 42? List its elements.</li>

<ol label="1.">
<li><p>List the distinct left cosets of the cyclic subgroup of <m>U_{13}</m> generated by 3.</p></li>
<li><p>For each group and subgroup, what is <m>G/H</m> isomorphic to?  Draw a picture of the groups and their cosets.
		<ol label="(a)">
		<li><p>  <m>G = \mathbb{Z}_2^3</m>  and  <m>H = \langle 111 \rangle</m>.  In this group, write triples as bit strings of length 3. </p></li>
		<li><p>  <m>G= \mathbb{R}^2</m>  and  <m>H = \{(a,a) \mid a\in\mathbb{R}\}</m></p></li>
		</ol>
	</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the subgroup <m>C = \{00000, 01101, 11110, 10011\}</m> of the group <m>S=\mathbb{Z}_2^5</m>. Suppose your answer to a multiple choice question with four possible responses is stored in five bits of computer memory using one of the four elements of  <m>C</m>.  Now suppose the computer is hacked but we know that no more than one of the five bits in your response has been changed.  Can your response be recovered?</p></li>
