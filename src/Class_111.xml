<p>Read Sections 11.5 of <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>. The main idea is that there are certain subsets of groups that qualify as groups in their own right.  This is an instance of a more general situation in mathematics where a structure can contain smaller structures.  The idea of a subset is the most simple case of this, but we have also seen subgraphs in the study of graphs and trees.</p>
