<idx>Sets, and operations on them</idx><section xml:id="reading-2"><title>Reading</title>
<p>Before class, read Sections 1.1 and 1.2 of Applied Discrete Structures.  Respond to the following question: How are the set operations union and intersection similar to the operations addition and multiplication on numbers, and how are they different?</p>
<p>Also, turn in solutions to these exercises:  Section 1.1: #2, and Section 1.2: #2 </p>

<li><p>Section 1.1 #4 (b), (c)</p></li>
<li><p>Section 1.2 #4 (b) and #6</p></li>
<li><p>Find two sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> for which <m>|A| = 5</m>, <m>|B| = 6</m>, and <m>|A\cup B| = 9</m>. What is <m>|A \cap B|</m>?</p></li>
<li><p>For any sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, define <m>A\times B = \{(a,b) \mid a\in A \text{ and } b \in B\}</m> and <m>AB = \{ab \mid a\in A \text{ and } b \in B\}</m>. If <m>A = \{1,2\}</m> and <m>B = \{2,3,4\}</m>,  what is <m>|A \times B|</m>? What is <m>|AB|</m>?</p></li>
<li><p>A common data structure for a software implementation of sets is a <q>bitmap.</q>  The way it works is if you want to work with subsets of a universe, <m>U</m>, with cardinality <m>n</m> you first establish an ordering of <m>U</m> when <m>u_k</m> is the <m>k</m>th element.  A set <m>A</m> is then represented by a string of <m>n</m> bits  <m>b_1b_2\dots b_n</m> when <m>b_k</m> is 1 if <m>u_k \in A</m> and is 0 otherwise.
In the following questions, assume <m>U=\{1,2,3,4,5\}</m> with the ordering as listed.
		<ol label="(a)">
			<li><p>What are the bit strings for the empty set and for <m>U</m>?</p></li>
			<li><p>What are the bit strings for <m>A=\{1,2,3\}</m> and <m>B=\{1,3,5\}</m>?</p></li>
			<li><p>What are the general rules for determining the the bit strings for <m>A\cap B</m> and <m>A \cup B</m>?  What their bit strings in this particular case?</p></li>
