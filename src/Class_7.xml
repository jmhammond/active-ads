<p>Response question: Explain why every proposition implies a tautology.</p>
<p>Also, turn in solutions to these exercises: 
	<ul><li><p><ol label="(a)">
<li><p>Construct the truth table for <m>x= (p \land  \neg q) \lor  (r \land  p)</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>Find an example other than <m>x</m> itself of a proposition generated by <m>p</m>, <m>q</m>, and <m>r</m> that is equivalent to <m>x</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>Find an example of a proposition that is not equivalent to <m>x</m> and that implies <m>x</m>.</p></li>
<li><p> Find an example of a proposition that is not equivalent to <m>x</m> and that is implied by <m>x</m>.</p></li>
</ol></p></li>
		<li><p>Show that the common fallacy <m>(p\to  q) \land  \neg p \Rightarrow  \neg q</m> is not a law of logic.</p></li>

<li><p>Find a proposition that is equivalent to <m>p \lor  q</m> and uses only conjunction and negation. </p></li>
<li><p><!-- Based on a problem from Oscar Levin's book -->
        Frankie Fib was telling you what he consumed yesterday afternoon.
        He tells you, <q>I had either popcorn or raisins.
        Also, if I had cucumber sandwiches, then I had soda.
        But I didn't drink soda or tea.</q>
        Of course you know that Frankie is the worlds worst liar,
        and everything he says is false.
        What did Frankie have to eat and drink?
      </p></li>
<li><p>Construct the truth table for <m>(p \rightarrow q) \land (q \rightarrow r) \land (r \rightarrow p)</m>.   Notice anything about the result?</p></li>
<li><p>The significance of the Sheffer Stroke is that it is a <q>universal</q> operation in that all other logical operations can be built from it.
<ol label="(a)">
<li><p>Prove that <m>p | q</m> is equivalent to <m>\neg (p \land  q)</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>Prove that <m>\neg p \Leftrightarrow  p | p</m>.</p></li>
<li><p>Build <m>\land</m> using only the Sheffer Stroke.</p></li>
<li><p>Build <m>\lor</m> using only the Sheffer Stroke.</p></li>
